                If sole proprietors choose to operate a business under a name other than their personal name, they need to register that name with the state, county, city, or town in which the business operates.
                </p>
                <p>
                If you own a corporation or an LLC, you may choose to operate under a different name than the original legal name of your business. If so, you will need to register this alternate name in the state, county, city, or town where you conduct business.
                </p>
                <p>
                You will need to register your DBA name prior to opening a business bank account for your alternate name and before advertising or transacting business under another name.

                    <li>Do business under a name other than your personal name</li>

                <h3>Why would a sole proprietor need to file a DBA?</h3>
                <p>
                Sole proprietors often file DBAs in order to do business under a name other than their personal names. For example, John Smith might register "Smith Plumbing" as a DBA.
                </p>
                <p>
                If you operate your business under a name other than your personal name, you will need to register your DBA with the appropriate state, county, city, or town office.

                <p>
                To avoid doing business under only one partner's name, or under both names, partnerships often file DBA names with their state, county, city, or town government offices. For example, John Smith and Bob Jones might file the DBA, "Smith and Jones Enterprises."
                </p>
                <p>
                If you manage a partnership that operates under a DBA, you will need to register your DBA with the appropriate government office.

                <h3>Why would an LLC need to file a DBA?</h3>
                <p>
                If your LLC will operate under a DBA name, it must register its DBA with the appropriate state, county, city, or town government office. An LLC might file a DBA to market a new product or service, or to simply operate under an additional name.
                </p>
                <p>
                Some state and local government offices refer to a DBA as a "trade name" or "assumed name," since these names usually reflect the company's line of business more accurately than its legal name. Let incorporate.com help your LLC register a DBA name.

                <p>
                Corporations often file DBAs for additional business names. A corporation might file a DBA to market a new product or service under a unique name. In other cases, corporations simply operate under more than one name.
                </p>
                <p>
                If your corporation will use a DBA in its home state or any other state, it must register the DBA with the appropriate government office at the state, county, city, or town level. We can help your corporation register a DBA name today.

                <p>
                In many states, more than one business can file the same DBA name at the local level. However, a DBA cannot include a corporate indicator such as "Inc." or an LLC indicator such as "LLC," unless the business is a corporation or LLC.
                </p>
                <p>
                Corporations and LLCs can sometimes file DBAs that include "Inc." or "LLC," depending upon the laws of the particular state, county, city, or town.
                </p>
                <p>
                There is no limit to the number of DBA names you can register. You can file as many DBAs as your business needs.

                <p>
                State and local offices have unique rules for DBA expiration. While some state and local governments require businesses to renew DBA filings, others do not. If your business must renew its DBA registration, your state or local government office typically sends a renewal notice to the business.
