                A company needs to qualify in the states where it is "doing business," Generally, a company is doing business in a state if it has regular, repeated and continuous business contacts of a local nature in that state. Typically, a business is doing business in a state where it:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Has an office, employees, and advertises</li>
                    
                </ul>
                <p onClick={() => scrollToSection('top')} className="FQA_Register_in_Additional_States-back-to-top">Back to Top</p>
            </div>

            <div id="Question_4" className="FQA_Register_in_Additional_States-section">
                <h3>What could happen to my business if my company doesn't qualify in a state where it does business?</h3>
                <p>
                In some cases, a business can be liable to pay penalties or back taxes for the time period that they were doing business without qualification. Another downside is that in some cases, your company will not have access to the courts in that state. This means you will not be able to bring a lawsuit in that state. Almost all states impose penalties, and in some states these penalties can be applied against the officers and directors of the company. In one state, Louisiana, officers and directors not only face civil penalties for failing to qualify, but can face a prison sentence as well.
