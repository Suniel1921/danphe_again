                        In order to enjoy the best-possible tax savings for your business, you need to have the right tax classification. Many c corporations and LLCs elect to file for s corporation status because of the advantages this classification provides their businesses, including:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pass-through taxation (the company's tax obligation is passed along to shareholders)
                            </li>
                            <li>Once-a-year tax filing requirement (vs. quarterly for a C Corporation)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                        In order to elect an s corporation status, companies must file the IRS S Corp Form 2553, "Election By a Small Business Corporation." Timing is critical with Form 2553. The s corp election deadline dictates that it must be filed within 75 days of your c corporation or LLC's anniversary of formation, or within 75 days of a new year. If you have questions about a potentially late s corp election, please speak with a representative from incorporate.com who may be able to help you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Companies often find it worthwhile to file Form 2553 for the thousands of dollars in potential tax savings an S Corporation status can provide their C Corporation or LLC.
