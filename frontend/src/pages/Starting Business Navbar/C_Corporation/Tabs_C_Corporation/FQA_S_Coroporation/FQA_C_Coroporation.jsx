                <h3>Is a c corp required to have a registered agent?</h3>
                <p>Yes. State laws require all corporations to maintain a registered address with the Secretary of State in each state where they do business. The person or company located at that address, known as the Registered Agent, must remain available during all business hours. A Registered Agent receives and forwards important legal documents and state correspondence on behalf of the business.</p>

            <div id="Question_4" className="fqa-c-corporation-section">
                <h3>What do I need to do after I form my c corp?</h3>
                <p>Most states require c corps to file annual reports and pay franchise taxes to maintain their good standing. Failure to file annual reports and pay franchise taxes can result in fines, notices, and the inability to conduct business.</p>
                <p>
                State laws require c corps to hold annual meetings of shareholders and directors and record meeting minutes. Owners and directors of a c corp use corporate minutes to reflect changes in management and important corporate activities.

                <h3>What is the organizational structure of a c corp?</h3>
                <p>The company is owned by shareholders, who elect directors. The directors set a vision for the corporation and are responsible for the management of the corporation. The officers and managers hired by the directors are responsible with carrying out the vision on a day-to-day basis.</p>

                <h3>Can a c corp own an LLC?</h3>
                <p>Since a c corp is its own legal identity (separate from that of its owner), a c corp can own an interest in an LLC.</p>

            <div id="Question_7" className="fqa-c-corporation-section">
                <h3>Can a c corp own an s corporation (s corp)?</h3>
                <p>An s corp can own a c corp. However, a c corp cannot own an s corp. Much of this has to do with the structuring of a c corp vs an s corp. To learn more about what is an s corp and how it differs from a c corp, please visit the s corp page.</p>
