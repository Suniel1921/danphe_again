                    What kind of business do you want to create? When looking at business types, many business owners choose to form a limited liability company (LLC), especially in the state of Delaware. Creating an LLC is a good way to "wall off" your personal assets from your company's liabilities. Forming an LLC is a better fit for many owners than a sole proprietorship or a general partnership.

                How to Start a Delaware LLC
                </h2>
                <p>
                The process begins with choosing an appropriate business name that is not already in use. Then, you will want to decide whether you are forming a single member or a multi-member Delaware LLC.
                </p>
                <p>
                Next, Delaware LLC forms need to be completed and filed with the state. A Delaware LLC operating agreement is recommended for starting an LLC, though it is not required by state law. For businesses with more than one member, the Delaware LLC operating agreement will clearly define each member's role, responsibilities and ownership share of the business.
                </p>
                <p>
                You will also need a registered agent. The registered agent for a Delaware LLC must have a physical address in the state of Delaware. The registered agent will receive and forward to you any legal paperwork in the event of a lawsuit.
