                As you can see, there are significant advantages to incorporating in Delaware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                Are There Disadvantages to Incorporating in Delaware?

                </h2>
                <p>
                Some smaller companies that only do business in their home state may not benefit from the advantages of incorporating in DE. If they intend to stay small and only operate in their state, incorporating in both Delaware and paying an additional fee to their home state will cost the company money that may not be needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                However, the legal protections that are afforded you as a Delaware corporation or LLC may override this cost. As Ray Garrett, Jr., former Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, says,
                </p>
                <p>
                "Why do they go to Delaware? …You're concerned about flexibility, capital structure, and corporate purposes. The fact is that Delaware has more law and has answered more questions through its decisions. …It is easier to get an answer to a question under the Delaware Act than it is under say, the Illinois law, which has very few cases in the corporate area."
                </p>
                
                
                <p>
                In the end, even a small company has good reason to choose Delaware for its incorporation advantages.
