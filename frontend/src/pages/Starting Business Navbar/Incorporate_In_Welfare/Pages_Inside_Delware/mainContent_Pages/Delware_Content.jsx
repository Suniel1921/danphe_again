//                 To start your business and incorporate in Delaware, begin by choosing a business name. You will need to confirm your business name meets naming requirements and is not already in use. You will then need to file Delaware articles of incorporation. You will need a Federal Tax ID if you intend to hire employees or open a bank account in the name of the business.
//                 </p>
//                 <p>
//                 Once the process to incorporate your business in Delaware is complete, you will receive a Delaware certificate of incorporation. The certificate of incorporation is sometimes asked for as proof of your business entity when opening bank accounts or applying for other financing. Finally, you will need a Delaware Registered Agent to receive legal paperwork on your behalf.
