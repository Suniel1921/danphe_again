                <p>
                    Educational, scientific, religious, and charitable organizations typically form nonprofit corporations to provide limited liability for the people involved in their management. Incorporating your nonprofit association can help you to establish the legal protection that separates the personal savings and possessions of those involved in the nonprofit from the activities of the corporation.

                    4 Reasons to Incorporate your Nonprofit Association:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A nonprofit corporation enjoys exemption from corporate income taxes on profits from activities related to their purpose.</li>
                    <li>Qualifying for a tax exemption is harder for associations than for corporations. Without tax-exempt status, your group is unlikely to qualify for many public and private grants.</li>
                    <li>Donors can deduct gifts to your group on their federal and state tax income returns once your organization becomes a tax-exempt nonprofit corporation.</li>
                    <li>Members and directors of nonprofit corporations are generally protected from personal liability, meaning that their own money, houses, and cars aren't at risk. That's not true for an unincorporated association.</li>

                <p>
                    Most states require that nonprofits register in a state before soliciting donations from residents of that state, and some states require registration if the nonprofit can receive donations from within that state (e.g., over the Internet), even if the nonprofit does not directly solicit donations from that state. In addition, the IRS requires disclosure of all states in which a nonprofit is registered on Form 990 if the nonprofit has income of more than $25,000 per year. Penalties for failure to register can include being forced to give back donations or facing criminal charges. incorporate.com can assist you in registering in those states in which you intend to solicit donations.

                    A nonprofit organization that receives substantial portions of its income either from governmental sources or from direct contributions from the general public may qualify as a publicly supported organization under section 509(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. This designation leads to less regulation, exemption from certain taxes that private charities must pay, and other benefits. However, due to the complexity of the laws and regulations governing designation as a publicly supported organization, incorporate.com recommends that any nonprofit interested in this designation seek legal and tax counsel to provide the necessary advice.

                <p>
                    Most individuals or groups form nonprofit corporations in the state in which they will primarily operate. Advantages of forming a nonprofit corporation in your home state include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fewer complications, if you only plan to operate the nonprofit in your home state</li>
                    <li>No need to pay franchise taxes and file annual reports in more than one state</li>
                    <li>Less cost</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Many companies conduct business throughout the United States and abroad. A nonprofit corporation with business locations in multiple states may form in a single state, then register to do business in other states. This means that nonprofit corporations must formally register, file annual reports, and pay annual fees in every state in which they conduct business.

The person or company located at that address, known as the Registered Agent, must remain available during all business hours. A Registered Agent receives and forwards important legal documents and state correspondence on behalf of the business.

                <h3>What's the difference between a public charity and a private foundation?</h3>
                <p>
                    Every exempt charitable organization is classified as either a public charity or a private foundation. They are distinguishable primarily by the level of public involvement in their activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Generally, organizations that are classified as public charities have an active program of fundraising and receive contributions from many sources (including the general public, governmental agencies, corporations, private foundations or other public charities). Examples include: churches, hospitals, schools, colleges and universities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By contrast, private foundations typically have a single major source of funding (usually gifts from one family or corporation rather than funding from many sources). Many offer grants to other charitable organizations and to individuals, rather than operate charitable programs.

                    Yes, depending upon the nature of its exemption, your tax-exempt corporation may jeopardize its tax-exempt status if it engages in certain activities. For example, section 501(c)(3) charitable organizations may not intervene in political campaigns or conduct substantial lobbying activities. Consult an attorney for more specific information about your organization.
