                        <p>If your organization is involved primarily in educational, scientific, religious, or charitable endeavors, you'll probably want to form a nonprofit corporation for the liability protections and tax advantages this status provides.</p>
                        <h2>How to Start A Nonprofit Organization</h2>
                        <p>Incorporating your nonprofit will set legal protections in place that can keep you and your directors' personal assets separate from the company's liabilities. There are a number of other benefits to forming a nonprofit, as well.</p>
                        <p>
                            In general, nonprofit corporations enjoy the following benefits:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Limited liability protection. </b>Directors and officers are not personally liable for the organization's debts and liabilities.</li>
                            <li><b>Perpetual existence. </b>The corporation continues even if a director leaves the business or passes away.</li>
                            <li><b>Eligibility for grants. </b> Nonprofits may be eligible for certain public and private grants.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            While nonprofits are bound by different state laws than for-profit enterprises, in general their formation processes are quite similar. Like a regular corporation, nonprofits must file Articles of Incorporation with the state in which they wish to incorporate.

                        <p>n addition, the IRS requires nonprofit organizations seeking tax-exempt status to file Form 1023. Several states also require organizations to file for state-level tax-exemption. The nonprofit status most commonly sought by organizations is the Internal Revenue Service's 501(c) tax-exempt status. Organizations that qualify for 501(c) status enjoy the following advantages:

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Tax-exempt status.</b>Qualifying nonprofits can apply for federal and state tax-exempt status</li>
                            <li><b>Enhanced credibility.</b>Potential donors may be more inclined to give to an organization that has an official nonprofit status
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Tax-deductible donations.</b> Donations made by individuals to the nonprofit corporation may be tax-deductible
                            </li>

                            </li>
