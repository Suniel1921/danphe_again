                <h3>What is the cost of setting up an S Corp?</h3>
                <p>
                The costs associated with setting up an s corp, LLC, and c corp are similar. However, there are other intangible factors you must take into account. Every s corp is unique and comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Among the subchapter s corp requirements you must weigh when considering this particular status is that s corps must file articles of incorporation, keep a record of corporate minutes, hold shareholder and director meetings, as well as allow their shareholders to weigh in with a vote concerning company decisions. S corps can also only offer common stock to investors, making fund-raising more difficult. If you are still undecided as to the pros and cons of declaring your business an s corp, please contact incorporate.com to speak to someone who may be able to set you on the right path.

                <h3>Is an s corp required to have a registered agent?</h3>
                <p>
                Yes. State laws require all corporations to maintain a registered address with the Secretary of State in each state where they do business. The person or company located at that address, known as the registered agent, must remain available during all business hours. A registered agent receives and forwards important legal documents and state correspondence on behalf of the business.

                <h3>What do I need to do after I form my s corp?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most states require s corps to file annual reports and pay franchise taxes to maintain their good standing. Failure to file annual reports and pay franchise taxes can result in fines, notices, and the inability to conduct business. You may be able to file many of these S Corp documents online. incorporate.com can help you ensure each of your forms are correctly filled out and submitted according to schedule.</li>
                    <li>State laws require s corps to hold annual meetings of shareholders and directors and record meeting minutes. Owners and directors of an s corp use corporate minutes to reflect changes in management and important corporate activities.</li>
                    <li>Additionally, almost all state, county, and local governments require s corps to complete business license, permit, and tax registration applications before beginning to operate.</li>

                <h3>What is the organizational structure of an s corp?</h3>
                <p>
                The company is owned by shareholders, who elect directors. The directors set a vision for the corporation and are responsible for the management of the corporation. The officers and managers hired by the directors are responsible for carrying out the vision on a day-to-day basis.

                <p>
                An s corp can own an LLC. However, only single-member LLCs can own a stake in an s corp. One of the tax advantages of an s corp is similar to that of an LLC in that both can pass their profits and losses through to their personal income tax report each year.

                <p>
                Generally the owners of a corporation cannot be held liable for the debts and obligations of the corporation. However, if owners treat the corporation as an extension of themselves – sometimes referred to as "disregarding the corporation form" – such as by commingling personal and corporate funds or making important decisions without holding board meetings or passing resolutions, then creditors can attempt to hold owners liable for the debts and obligations of the company-often called "piercing the corporate veil." The "corporate veil" can also be lost if a corporation is terminated by a state for failure to file required forms or pay required fees and taxes.
